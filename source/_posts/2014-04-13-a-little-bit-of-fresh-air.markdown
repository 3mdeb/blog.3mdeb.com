It is over 9 months since my last post. As you see since then I refreshed look
and feel of my blog a little bit. Theme was changed to
[whitespace](https://github.com/lucaslew/whitespace), because of my
minimalistic inspiration induced by [Tommi Kaikkonen](http://www.kaikkonendesign.fi/). Meanwhile AddThis improved their
products offer by [Smart Layers](https://www.addthis.com/get/smart-layers) and
you can see how they works on left and upper right. I hope that thanks to this
improvement sharing valuable content would be easier.
