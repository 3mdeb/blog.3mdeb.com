# Kanban method in a consulting company



Before we start we need to know what is that Kanban. Let me show you a short explanation.

> **Kanban** is a method for managing knowledge work which balances demands for work with the available capacity for new work. 
Work items are visualized to give participants a view of progress and process, from task definition to customer delivery. 
Team members "pull" work as capacity permits, rather than work being "pushed" into the process when requested.
>
> In software development, Kanban provides a visual process-management system which aids decision-making about what, 
when and how much to produce. Although the method (inspired by the Toyota Production System and lean manufacturing originated in 
software development and IT, it may be applied to any professional service whose work outcome is intangible rather than physical.

## Tools

In our company we're using [Trello](https://trello.com/) that have electrical boards to visualize our workflow in all of project. 
Our arrays are divided into appropriate categories: Backlog, To Do, In Progress, Verification, Done and Project Status, 
where We can discuss about project features or problems.

## Cards (Kanbans)

According the Kanban method we give out a kanban cards to assigned employees. The card is very important in the whole project process. 
According to her, we measure our work and set time for each stage in the design, 
develop and testing solutions in embedded systems projects. Additionally inside the card we can discuss about feature and 
look what happens last time.

## Workflow

The card life begins in ToDo, sometimes it happens there we have a lot of big task and cards with small priority are move for Backlog, 
where they waiting for free moment to solve them. We are trying to minimize transfer cards from right to left, 
our goal is to streamline this process.

## Rules

To make kanban work, each employee must follow these rules:

- [ ] Do not take a lot of tasks,
- [ ] Keep order,
- [ ] Discuss about tasks,
- [ ] Don't race for who will do more - focus on teamwork,
- [ ] When somebody have problem our task is to help together. 

These rules is only a sample but improve the whole process, there aren't create the artificial stack of tasks for verification, 
such tasks are mostly inaccurate and return to the left. Good comunication helps, what if some feature is expired and we dont know 
about it? One sentence in communication can save much of time. 

## Pros and cons

The advantages are:

- Universal - can be used in visualize company overview, project or employee individual workflow
- Creating a WIP (Work In Progress) limit - it prevents overproduction and quickly detects bottlenecks
- Clarity - one look and you know where is project
- Stream management - systematic time and effort measurement to optimize processes.

 And cons:

- Need for continuous control
- Commitment of each employee
- Incorretly managed will turn into a battlefield where employees struggle, who has done more and create a nasty mess on the work cards. 

## Summary

Kanban is designed for companies where software is deployed and delivered in cycles, this choice was very useful in our company. 
By using it we increase the order in the organization of our tasks and make it ease for finding needed information by reducing 
the volume of communication and grouping it into individual pages. Now we don't have to look for another tool but maybe in 
the future we will try need to mix some metodologies for better work.
