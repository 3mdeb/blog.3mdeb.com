Recently one of my customer asked me about evaluating effort for porting
coreboot to some platform. Key problem was that this platform used 1.8V SPI.
The only platform that I had with this voltage level was LeMaker HiKey.
Unfortunately default Linaro images do not expose SPI as device, what is
required by flashrom.

## Compile flashrom

```
sudo apt-get install subversion libpci-dev libusb-dev libusb-1.0.0-dev
svn co svn://flashrom.org/flashrom/trunk flashrom
cd flashrom
make
```
