Last days I do not have much time to write posts on blog. Providing consulting
services fill almost whole time dedicated to learning and sharing knowledge,
because of that I decided to spent some time while sitting in hotel and waiting
for next day of ELCE 2016 conference in Berlin.

I would like to go through interesting talks I attended and note couple ideas
that get listening Embedded Linux experts.

## Keynote

Day was started, by Tim Bird and his talk with Greg Kroah-Hartman. One thing to
note was information that there will be no change in patches handling and
community will stick with plain email. It looks that there were some proposals
to adapt gerrit, but patchwork seems to be more liked by Greg, if he had to
choose anything else then email. More information in [this presentation](https://github.com/gregkh/presentation-stone-tools/blob/master/stone-tools.pdf).

In talk they mention that Greg gave first technical talk from long time.

BTW when looking for videos I remembered that [eLinux Events site](http://elinux.org/Events#Past_events)
have amazed number of recent information from conferences. I also found that
there is some number of webinars that maybe interesting.
