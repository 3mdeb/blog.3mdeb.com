Recent days we get the announcement of about releasing Raspberry Pi 3. Those of
you who play with embedded systems or just try to make things probably still
got old Raspberry Pi (1). Because during time old platforms loose value as
potential candidate for new projects I decided to sacrifice my old RPi and make
test server from it.

One of my customer required testing his software against PXE server with
various configurations. I realized that using my home network with my TP-Link
router I have no way to create such configuration on server machine I usually
use. My other platforms like A20 boards, Odroid or RPi2 are occupied by some
projects. I recall that I have old RPi that can be used for that purpose.
