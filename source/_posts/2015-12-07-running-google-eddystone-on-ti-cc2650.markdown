According to documentation on GitHub, Eddystone should be ready to use on [TI CC2640](https://github.com/google/eddystone/tree/master/eddystone-url/implementations/TI-CC2640),
which is compatible with CC2650. Instruction is straight forward but whole
environment cannot be built without solving couple small issues.

From time to time I'm using TI Code Composer Studio to develop software for
CC3200. I also keep packages to support MSP430, which is still on my TODO list.
Not sure if this is related but my Windows 10 refuse to install BLE Stack 2.1
or older version.

I started thread to solve that problem [here](https://e2e.ti.com/support/wireless_connectivity/f/538/t/475341)
