I use mutt/mutt-kz, offlineimap, afew, msmtp and notmuch for couple years, but
some thing started to cause problems for me. First thing is extensive use of
tags I use lot of them starting with spam and ending with shopping, social
media etc. Tool that should handle that is [afew](https://github.com/teythoon/afew) unfortunately it is no maintained well
enough and I encounter too much problems with it (building filters, rules
adding automation etc.). For those reasons I decided to simplify things a
little bit and rely more on on notmuch not on intermediate software.
