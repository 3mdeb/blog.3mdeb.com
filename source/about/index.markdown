Hello,
I'm Piotr Kr√≥l owner of 3mdeb, which is Poland-based brand dedicated to
help small companies change their idea into products by recommending
technology, building prototypes and developing required software. I'm a
Embedded Systems Consultant with over 7 years of professional experience. I was
involved in firmware development and low level programming for microcomputer
(x86, ARM) and embedded (ARM, AVR, MSP430) CPU architectures. I'm looking for
challenging projects in area of embedded systems, general purpose low level
programming and reverse engineering.

More about me you can find on social media sites.
